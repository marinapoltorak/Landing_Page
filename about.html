      I was born in the Soviet Union to my great surprise. I moved quickly to correct the situation. When my parents emigrated to the United States, I (three years old at the time)stowed away in their baggage. I has been an American citizen since the age of eight.

    <p class="about">Just like Mr. Asimov, I was born in the Soviet Union.    Unlike him, I wasn't released until 1976 (Yes, I am old. I'm 55. We will return to that.) Do you remember Jimmy Carter's grain for jews deal? Well, that is how we got a chance to leave the Soviet Union behind.<img src="css/img/USSR.jpg" alt="Marina" class="one"> <br><br>To <em>my</em> unending surprise, shock even, my family was dropped into Houston, Texas. A prosperous oil town that instantly emerged from that prosperity as I landed. Remember the gas lines? No? You don't? Many of you are too young to remember 1976. Google it. It was sad.

      <p class="about">
      So, Houston. Houston was where and when I learned rebellion. So, Houston. Houston was where and when I learned rebellion. Rebellion against my old-world father, against gender roles, against formal education, against monogamy. My poor parents! I hit puberty and America at the same time.
      In 1982, I almost failed to graduate from highschool. Had to take home ec, where I learned how to sow an apron and make lasagna. Then I pretended to go to the University of Houston, but the world was full of cute boys and great music. I was distracted. I rebelled. You must remember that. I moved in with a man and withdrew to Boca Raton, Florida. We built kit airplanes, aquired cats, fought and broke up. I devoted myself to high end electronic sales and found another man to follow. This time, it was Oregon. And my baby. And an old commune in the coastal range valley called Alpha Farm. Where babydaddy and I went our separate way.

      <p class="about">
      Time, unstoppable time, passes.I met the love of my life, married (25 years now) and moved to Portland.
      For 25 years now, I've been working as a counselor. I am a cognitive behavioral therapis. I am an addictions counselor. I have managed a team of gang mentors that work in our community. For over a decade I've gone into Oregon's medium and high security prisons to teach decision making and problem solving to an ever changing cohort of 18 to 25 year old boys. I am trauma informed, brain savvy and can make a grown man cry at a hundred paces. Really. Try me.

      <p class="about3">That work was deeply rewarding and gave me much to live for, however...</p>
      <p class="about2">Over the years I've lost and grieved many clients. Lost them to gun violence, to heroin addictions, to long prison sentences. The trauma's weight on me became all encompassing. It started affecting my mood, my productivity, my health. Change became necessary.</p>
      <p class="about3">So, here I am. Fat, fifty-ish, fabulous, frightened and furiously studying coding at Epicodus.<br><br>
